  <summary><h2> My Journey on Programming World ðŸ’» </h2></summary>
  <br>
  <p>From early childhood I was very curious, I enjoyed to learn and explore new things to me. In my High School education, I was introduced to C programming. Eventually I wanted to know and learn more & got associated with web programming.</p>

  <p>The early days were marked by the excitement of unraveling the mysteries of coding languages, like a voyage into uncharted territory. As I delved into the intricacies of programming, each challenge became an opportunity for growth and mastery. The joy of crafting my first lines of code, solving complex problems, and witnessing tangible outcomes fueled my passion. Along the way, I've had the privilege of learning from seasoned mentors, collaborating with brilliant minds, and contributing to a myriad of projects that have shaped my skills and perspectives. This journey is a perpetual exploration, marked by continuous learning, a thirst for innovation, and an unwavering commitment to honing my craft. The programming world, with its ever-evolving landscapes and limitless possibilities, has become the canvas on which I paint my aspirations, one line of code at a time.</p>
